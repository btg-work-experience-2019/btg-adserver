# BTG Ad Server
A basic adserver for managing display ads

## Getting Started
### Clone the repo
Make sure you are in the right directory before you do this!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vzm-work-experience-2019/btg-adserver.git
```


### Creating a virtual environment

Remember: We _never_ create virtual environments in our _project_ directory!

1. Create a virtual environment if this is a new project
```bash
$ python3 -m venv <PATH_TO_DESIRED_LOCATION>
```

2. Activate the virtual enironment
```bash
$ source <PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV>/bin/activate
```
